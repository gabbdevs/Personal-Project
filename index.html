      <p id="Me">
        My interest in technology began way back in Senior High School, where
        I studied <strong><i>TVL-ICT</i></strong> with a specialization in
        <strong>Computer Systems Servicing</strong>. It all started with a
        simple PC-building activity that sparked my curiosity. While
        researching the best PC specifications, I ended up learning far more
        than expected—such as CPU generations, types of storage devices, GPU
        variants, and more. Since then, my passion for technology has
        continued to grow. I’ve become increasingly involved in learning
        various technologies, including programming, and I am now pursuing an
        Information Technology program in college.
